PowerShell execution on DCs
MDI generates an alert when remote code execution is performed against a DC, however if you need further investigation, you can run the following query to get the list of PowerShell command executed remotely to a DCÂ 

IdentityDirectoryEvents
| where ActionType == @"PowerShell execution"
| extend Command = todynamic(AdditionalFields)["PowerShell execution"]
| project Timestamp, ActionType, DeviceName, IPAddress, DestinationDeviceName, AccountName, AccountDomain, Command

If Defender for Endpoint is on the server/workstation you can run this to get more info.

DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where FileName in~ ("powershell.exe", "powershell_ise.exe")
|project ProcessCommandLine,DeviceName,AccountName
|limit 10
